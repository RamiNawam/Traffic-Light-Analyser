Here we are using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to analyze data. As a concrete example,
consider a computer vision system on a self-driving car that can distinguish between persons, cars, and
traffic lights from its camera input and plan its path accordingly. Another example is to differentiate 
between the green and red traffic lights so it can decide whether to stop or drive. we are writing a basic decision 
tree class in Java to classify the colour of a circle based on its location.
